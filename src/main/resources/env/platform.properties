# Platform Environment Configuration for Gateway
# 
# NOTE: This file should NOT contain self-referencing properties like:
#   PUBLIC_TYMB_URL=${PUBLIC_TYMB_URL}
# 
# Such definitions cause "Circular placeholder reference" errors.
# Environment variables are injected via Kubernetes Secrets/ConfigMaps.
# Application.yml already defines proper defaults for all properties.
#
# This file is intentionally kept minimal to avoid circular reference issues.
# All configuration should be done via:
# 1. Kubernetes Secrets (for sensitive data)
# 2. application.yml with ${ENV_VAR:default_value} syntax
# 3. Environment-specific application-{profile}.yml files
